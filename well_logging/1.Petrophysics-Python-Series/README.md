# Petrophysics-Python-Series
This series of Jupyter Notebooks take you through various aspects of working with Python and Petrophysical data.
A number of the notebooks are accompanied by either a Blog Post or a Medium article.

**Check out the binder button below** if you want to run these notebooks without needing to download them or install Python.
